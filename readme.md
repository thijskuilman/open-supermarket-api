# Open Supermarket API

Open Supermarket is an open source database which aims to contain all prices, nutritional data and barcodes of all major supermarkets in The Netherlands. 

## Why develop such a database?

There are some companies and apps that keep their own database with product data, but these are often not complete or completely inaccessible for third parties. Open Supermarket has a very specific goal: index all product data of the major Dutch supermarkets. If it achieves this goal, everyone will benefit: consumers can easily search for product data, developers can build apps with the API and existing databases can be expanded with Dutch productdata.

## Which supermarkets will be indexed? 

We have to start somewhere, so let's tackle the biggest two first:

* Jumbo
* Albert Heijn

After these are finished, we can start working on other supermarkets like Coop, Aldi and Plus.

## How to contribute

Right now contributing is not necesary, since Open Supermarket is still in its starting phase. Once the fundamentals are in place, contribution instructions will be detailed.
